# Welcome to my Github Page!
Greetings! My name is Sharan Aakash, and I am a Master's graduate in Automotive Systems from the HAN University of Applied Sciences. I am passionate about ADAS, Autonomous Driving, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning and enjoy working with data-driven or model-based algorithms.

## Education
Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering at Anna University.
Master's degree in Automotive Systems at HAN University of Applied Sciences, where I focused on System Modelling, Applied Control, Smart Mobility, and Big Data and Small Data. I am proficient in programming languages such as MATLAB, Simulink, Robot Operating System (ROS) and Python.

## Completed
Modelling Gantry crane dynamics: Developed a dynamic model of a gantry crane system to predict its behavior and optimize its control strategies.
Controller for lock and key system: Designed and implemented a control system for a lock and key mechanism to improve its performance.
Path Planning using Reinforcement Learning: Implemented a reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize the path planning for a robot navigating a maze.
Worm body pose classification using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Developed a CNN-based system to classify the poses of a worm using video data.
Speed Sign detector (CNN) - personal project: Built a CNN-based system to detect speed limit signs in images.
