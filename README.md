# Welcome to my Github Page!
Greetings! My name is Sharan Aakash, and I am a Master's graduate in Automotive Systems from the HAN University of Applied Sciences. I am passionate about ADAS, Autonomous Driving, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning and enjoy working with data-driven or model-based algorithms.

## Education
* Master's degree in Automotive Systems at HAN University of Applied Sciences, where I focused on System Modelling, Applied Control, Smart Mobility, and Big Data and Small Data. 
* Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering at Anna University.

## Project Respository
* Modelling Gantry crane dynamics: Developed a dynamic model of a gantry crane system to predict its behavior which can be used to design a controller.
* Controller for lock and key system: Designed and implemented a control system for a lock and key mechanism to improve its performance.
* Path Planning using Reinforcement Learning: Designed and developed a reinforcement learning algorithm to plan a path by by sensing the environment with an ultrasonic sensor and learning on its own.
* Worm body pose classification using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Developed a CNN-based system to classify the poses of a worm based shapes of English alphabetic letter using 15,000 image data.
* Speed Sign detector (CNN) - personal project: Built a CNN-based system to detect Dutch speed limit signs in images.
* Number Identifier - 

## Skills 
* Programming Languages: Python, MATLAB, Simulink, Robot Operating System (ROS), SQL.
* Frameworks and Libraries: TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV, Keras.
* Data Science and Analytics: Data visualization, Data manipulation, Data cleaning, Statistical analysis, Machine learning, Deep learning.
